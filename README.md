This repository contains the code of a simple R-Shiny web app which
downloads and visualizes the data of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). The
**features** of the applications are:

-   Downloads daily case statistics of the Coronavirus by country.
-   Let the user select country, region and metrics to be shown.
-   Shows a nice time series plot of the daily and cumulated metrics.
