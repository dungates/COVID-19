This repository contains the code of a simple R-Shiny web app which downloads and
visualizes the data of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). The **features** of the applications are: 

* Downloads daily case statistics of the Coronavirus by country.
* Let the user select country, region and metrics to be shown.
* Shows a nice time series plot of the daily and cumulated metrics.
